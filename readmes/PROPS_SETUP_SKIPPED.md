## Adding Props Later (If Needed)

If you later want props, just add one of these:
- **The Odds API** (free tier: 100 requests/month)
- **Paid proxy service** (enables sportsbook scraping)
- **Residential proxies** ($10-50/month)

Your system architecture is **ready to integrate props anytime** - just add the data source.

## Summary

**Your system works great for game picks.** Prop bets are optional and can be added later if needed. Everything is deployed and ready to use.
